# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.1] - 2025-11-06

### Changed
- **UI Improvements**: Updated `json_viewer.py` and `FTA_Editor_UI.py` with minor visual enhancements
  - Probabilities now display side by side (Gate:  |  P_base: X.X | P_calc: X.X) to save space
  - Added proper cell height to prevent text cutoff in node labels
  - Applied Times New Roman font consistently across the entire diagram
  - Improved node name and probability text visibility
  - Added checkbox to hide nodes with zero probability.
  - Improved Preview UI resolution.
  - Added "New Analysis" button to create new FTA.
  - Fixed graph UI bug. Now the same order is preserved for FTA tree and graph view.

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-01

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: AND Gate Probability Calculation**: Fixed incorrect calculation that was multiplying parent's base probability with children probabilities
  - **Before**: `parent_base_prob × ∏(child_probabilities)` - incorrectly included parent's base probability
  - **After**: `∏(child_probabilities)` - correctly calculates as product of children only
  - **Impact**: AND gates now follow standard Fault Tree Analysis principles
  - **Note**: Existing FTA diagrams with AND gates may show different (but correct) probabilities if parent nodes had base probabilities ≠ 1.0
- Updated test suite to reflect correct AND gate behavior (all 13 tests pass)
- Updated documentation to clarify that parent base probability is ignored when logic gates are applied with children

### Changed
- `_recalculate_fta_probabilities()` method now correctly ignores parent base probability for AND gates
- Test expectations updated in `test_probability_calculation.py`
- Documentation updated in `PROBABILITY_VALIDATION.md`

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- **ETA (Event Tree Analysis) Mode**: Top-down probability calculation for accident sequence analysis
- **Metadata Support**: Title, date, and mode fields saved with analyses
- **Top Bar UI**: Mode selector dropdown, title field, and date field
- **Hierarchical Excel Export**: Tree structure exported with nested columns
- **Dynamic Tree Labels**: Changes between "Fault Tree" and "Event Tree" based on mode
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: User guide, API reference, ETA documentation
- **Docker Support**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization
- **Test Suite**: Complete test coverage for ETA mode and core functionality

### Changed
- **JSON Format**: Now includes metadata (backward compatible with legacy format)
- **Excel Export**: Hierarchical columns instead of flat rows
- **Calculation Engine**: Supports both FTA (bottom-up) and ETA (top-down) modes

### Fixed
- Probability calculation edge cases
- Circular reference handling
- Zero probability node detection

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-30

### Added
- Excel export with hierarchical column structure
- Color-coding by depth level in Excel
- Auto-adjusted column widths
- Wrapped text for better readability

### Changed
- Excel export format from flat to hierarchical

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- Code refactoring: Split into UI and Core modules
- `FTA_Editor_core.py`: Core business logic
- `FTA_Editor_UI.py`: User interface layer
- Comprehensive test suite (19 tests)
- API for programmatic usage

### Changed
- Project structure: Separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and testability

### Deprecated
- None (original FTA_Editor.py preserved for backward compatibility)

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-01

### Added
- Initial FTA Editor release
- Fault tree creation and editing
- Probability calculations with AND/OR gates
- Node linking system
- JSON export/import
- XML export
- Graphviz diagram visualization
- Live preview with zoom/pan

## Release Notes

### Version 2.2.0 - ETA Mode and Enhanced Features

This major release adds Event Tree Analysis (ETA) capability alongside the existing Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), making the tool suitable for both reliability analysis and accident sequence modeling.

**Key Highlights**:
- Dual-mode analysis (FTA/ETA) with easy switching
- Complete metadata support for better documentation
- Improved Excel export with visual hierarchy
- Production-ready with Docker support
- Comprehensive documentation for public use

**Migration Guide**:
- Legacy JSON files load automatically (default to FTA mode)
- No breaking changes to existing workflows
- New JSON format is recommended for new projects

**Docker Deployment**:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Programmatic Usage**:
```python
from src.FTA_Editor_core import FTACore
core = FTACore()
core.set_metadata(mode="ETA", title="Analysis")
```
